        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <h4>Updated: July 3rd, 2019 2:39 PM</h4>
        <h2>A Brief Introduction</h2>
        <p>This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information when you use our Service. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy. We use your Personal Information for providing and improving the Service. By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our <a href="https://flashnode.xyz/TOS.html">Terms and Conditions</a> We may be contacted <a href="https://discord.gg/ae2dGp4">using our discord</a></p>
        <h2>Personal Information</h2>
        <p>While using our Service, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you. Personally identifiable information may include, but is not limited to, your name, email, phone number, postal address ("Personal Information").

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>The security of your Personal information is important to us. We implement a variety of security measures to maintain safety of your personal information. All user provided data is stored in our databases (username, email, address, etc). Any sensitive informataion (such as passwords) is encrypted or hashed. We store your account password using a strong hash function. This would make it very expensive (and virtually impossible) for an attacker to recover your password if they gained access to the hashes. Private information such as credit card numbers are not stored in our database and never will be distributed to other organizations or persons.</p>
        
        <h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
        <p>Our Service may contain links to other sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit. We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites or services.</p>
        
        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
