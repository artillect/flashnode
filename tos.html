        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <h4>Updated: July 3rd, 2019 2:39 PM</h4>
        <h2>A Few Words</h2>
        <p>For the benefit of all of our customers, we have a few rules and regulations regarding our services. It is important that you follow them, so we've tried to make them as clear, short and easy-to-read as possible. For the purpose of this document, "your service" and similar terms refer to any service held by you, rented from us. "We" refers to us; FlashNode.</p>

        <p>If you have any confusion after reading our Terms of Service, feel free to contact support and request clarification on any one of these points. While we will try to give reasonable notice for major changes to this document, this isn't always possible - so check back frequently for updates By purchasing any service from our website, you accept and agree to be bound by our Terms of Service. We reserve the right to cancel, suspend or terminate any service provided with or without a refund or notice or warning for any reason. We also reserve the right to modify our Terms of Service at any time with or without informing the client. It is up to the client to periodically familiarize themselves with the recent Terms of Service. If any client does not comply with the new Terms of Service modifications, their service will be terminated at our discretion.</p>

        <h2>General</h2>
        <p>Please use common sense. If you think something you're doing could get you into trouble, it probably will. We reserve the right to terminate any service at any time without possibility of refund. Hopefully we won't have to. We reserve the right to change our Terms of Service at any time. It is your responsibility to keep yourself updated with our Terms of Service. Don't use your service to do anything that would be deemed illegal in the United States or your country of residence. Don't use your service to disrupt or intefere with any other FlashNode service. Additionally, don't use your service to disrupt or intefere with any other service on the internet. In order to use our service, you must be at least 13 years of age. If you are 13 or older but under 18 years of age, you must have your parent or legal guardianâ€™s permission to use our service. Please have them read through this agreement with you.</p>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>Your account is your account. Don't share your account details. Please open a ticket if you'd like to be able to give friends access to your game panel, their own account can be created. Failure to report account breaches may result in suspension or termination of services. As we have rules preventing you from sharing your account, we assume that any use of your service to violate these rules was done by you, therefore it will be you and your service that will be penalised. Furthermore, don't use your service to exploit flaws in our software or hardware, or the software or hardware of other internet services.</p>

        <h2>Payment</h2>
        <p>Services are not activated until the first payment is received. If you don't renew your service before it expires, you have a one (1) day grace period in which you can pay the invoice for overdue services without disruption or penalty. Beyond this period, your service will be suspended until it's paid for. After 24 hours, without payment, your service will be terminated, thus deleting your files from our servers. Any chargebacks or payment disputes will result in immediate account suspension. Please contact support if you have a problem, we are willing to help sort things out. We offer the ability to set up scheduled payments for the purpose of automatically adding credit to your account at your specified frequency. If you choose to schedule any automatic payments (e.g PayPal subscription) these are associated with your account and not any individual service. Account credit is non-refundable and non-withdrawable.</p>

        <h2>Refunds and Disputes</h2>
        <p>All refund requests must be made via a ticket on our discord server (if you do NOT have discord you will have to get it). The following services are not eligible for a refund: Website Reseller If a Server Management request has been fulfilled for the client, we cannot issue a refund for this addon or any related service. A payment made for the renewal of a service cannot be refunded. If the client opens a dispute, we reserve the right to suspend any and all of the client's services. All refunds will be provided as credit or via the original payment method at our discretion. If the client has opened any disputes on any transaction, refunds will only be provided at our discretion, and not in accordance with our refund policy. When a refund is issued, any related services will be terminated. 24 HOUR REFUND POLICY (MONEY BACK GUARANTEE) Subject to the conditions below, we can provide a refund within the first 24 hours of ordering a new service - all we ask is that you tell us why you wish to cancel your service and receive a refund. Each client is only eligible to claim our 24 Hour Refund Policy once. Refunds for services are available within the first 24 hours of a monthly plan commencing - please contact support to request a refund. Beyond this period, refunds are given solely at our discretion. All refund requests must be submitted via a cancellation request on our website. The 24 hours is counted from the time of order to the time the cancellation is submitted. The client may be asked why they wish to receive a refund before a refund is issued, in which our team may offer assistance to resolve the issue the client is experiencing. If there is no reponse from the client within 48 hours of our any of our messages, eligibility to claim the 24 hour refund will be lost. The client must provide a reason for the refund request, however the reason provided will not affect eligibility. The client will be asked for confirmation on their refund request before a refund is issued. If the client fails to make a confirmation within 48 hours of our request to do so, eligibility to claim the 24 hour refund will be lost. Our 24 hour refund policy only covers the first 24 hours after a new plan commences. Payments made for the renewal of services are not eligible for our 24 Hour Refund Policy. Opening a dispute on any of your payments will void eligibility for our 24 Hour Refund Policy. Our 24 hour money back guarantee only covers a single transaction per client account. If the client retracts the refund request or states that they do not confirm the refund, the request will become void. A new refund request can be submitted after this point, but will be treated as a new request and will only be eligible if 24 hours from the client's order has not passed. If a Server Management request is fulfilled, eligibility for the 24 hour refund immediately becomes void. Any client found to be creating multiple accounts in order to claim the 24 hour refund multiple times will be denied a refund.</p>

        <h2>Cancellations</h2>
        <p>If you do not wish to continue your service, you will need to submit a cancellation for the service from the FlashNode client area. You may contact our support if you require assistance with this. You may also wish to cancel any PayPal subscriptions you may have activated for your account. As FlashNode does not have access to the client's PayPal account we cannot and will not be responsible for incidental payments made from using the automatic payment subscription service.</p>

        <h2>Privacy</h2>
        <p>For security purposes, our website stores access logs with details for every visitor, which includes information such as your browser details and your IP address.

        <h2>Abuse</h2>

Generally, any violation of these terms may result in account suspension, termination or closure without refund. Any attempts to exploit any part of our system in any way may result in account suspension, termination or closure without refund.</p>
