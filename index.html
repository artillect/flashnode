            <p>I like FlashNode a lot they have a verity of services to choose from and help 24/7. I use it mostly for their support tickets to do personal private stuff on their server, they are really nice people are very eager to help out. They mostly talk to their clients or members when they have a chance which is a lot. I play a lot of online games these days and they have servers for that which I use to see or talk with people that have a common interest. They even host applicants which is crazy other servers hardly do that and stay shut in without talking to anyone, which I think is ignorant.  They even have parts on the server where you can buy stuff like as a example  the website specs and Website re-seller, I have never seen a server have something like that at all it's mostly hard to even Find stuff like that these days. These people are dedicated to helping out and I love that I would recommend people to use the Discord, Website, and Other services because you will not be cheated and always get the best.</p>
