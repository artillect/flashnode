            <h4>Liop</h4>
            <p>I like FlashNode a lot they have a verity of services to choose from and help 24/7. I use it mostly for their support tickets to do personal private stuff on their server, they are really nice people and are very eager to help out. These people are dedicated to helping out and I love that I would recommend people to use the Discord, Website, and Other services because you will not be cheated and always get the best.</p>

            <h4>Alduin</h4>
            <p>Something I really love about FlashNode is what you get for your money. I mean, it's astonishing how you can go to a different host, and get less, for more. These guys have it right. And their support is one of a kind. You definitely wont get anything better anywhere else. Not a lot of people offer life-time plans, but if they do, it's expensive, but with FlashNode, your prices are very cheap.</p>

            <h4>JumpyCSGO</h4>
            <p>I purchased the "Basic Plan" which only costs $1.00/MO. I had some trouble with setting it up, as I do not have much experience with website hosting but that doesn't matter. I reported my issue to FlashNode and they responded quickly and started fixing my issue immediately. I have had no issues so far with FlashNode. Definitely recommend hosting your website with FlashNode, they're very reliable and quick.</p>
